# Login and Registeration System

1- Android application: The login and registration system
2- PHP API : PHP webservices to interact with a MySQL database hosted in an external server or localhost.

The communication between the android application and the PHP API is achieved using Volley.

To use this system:

1- Place the PHP API (android_login_api folder) under www/html/ path for linux localhost or www for other host.
2- Change the WebServiceLinks.java file by replacing the URLs to yours.

--> It is needed in almost every android application!
